  <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      I have 10+years as project manager and I've grown fond of all different aspects of this role such as project planning, documentation, stakeholder management , project monitoring and managing risks and issues. I lead team discussions and have a great understanding that leading a project team is both science and art as you utilize sound methodology, tools and techniques as you implement a project, and yet also be cognizant that soft skills and other factors can have an impact on your project such as team dynamics, interaction with team members and different backgrounds and agenda from team members.
      I am now eagerly developing myself towards technology and have taken steps towards learning front-end web development with the personal goal of being able to lead development of systems and applications. I believe the future is in technology and I will actively be a part of its progress.
